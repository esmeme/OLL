Hello everyone. In the last unit we studied
the 10 basic vowels of Hangeul. In this unit,
we will now study the 14 basic consonants. First of all you will learn how
the 14 basic consonants were formed. And how each one of the 14 consonants
sound and also you will be able to create letters by combining the consonants
with the 10 vowels from last unit. Here are the original 17
letters of Sejong's creation. Now three of these are no longer in use. Can you guess which ones they might be? That's right. These three letters are no longer used. Now I've said that, one of the virtues
of Hangul is its simplicity. If you look carefully you will notice
that these 14 letters all consist of combinations or
manipulations of the same 5 symbols. Yes, only five symbols are used
to generate all the consonants. Take a look for a moment and see if
you can identify these basic symbols. Basic symbols are these. That wasn't that hard, was it? But, here is another question. Where did they come from? What was the inspiration for
the inventor's choice? Well, all of these letters were
formed after the shapes of the mouth and the other articulatory organs
we use when we are making sounds. In other words each symbol represents
how it's sound is vocalized. Five sides are involved in our
creation of the basic consonants. Which are the throat at the most
inside part, the molars and the palate, the lips at the most outside
part and the teeth at the inside again. Five elements: tree, fire soil metal and water. The principal five elements from
the Eastern philosophy was applied to the consonant sounds and
their position in the mouth. Consonants can be categorized into
five separate branches in modern linguistic terms. Velar. Alveolar. Labial. Dental. And glottal. The velar sound ㄱ is the shape of a tongue that blocks
the windpipe and the sound is made. When the real part of the tongue touches
the soft palate, also known as the velum. This sound has the shape when you
pronounce the final consonant [FOREIGN]. However, when pronounced as the initial
sound, it is pronounce soft K or G. The alveolar sound ㄴ  is
the shape of a tongue touching the gums of the upper teeth. This is the N sound in English. The labial sound mieum is the shape of
the lips opening after they have pushed. The dental sound siot has
a connection to teeth. This strong represents the tip of
the tongue that is touching the back part of the upper teeth. There isn't an exact equivalent
in the English sound, and it is slightly different
than the S and C sound. Finally, the glottal sound [FOREIGN]
is the shape of a throat and King [INAUDIBLE] thought that this sound
would best represent the epiglottis which is the space between
the vocal cords, and as a final consonant sound [FOREIGN]
is the same sound ng in song. Then, besides these five basic consonants, what are the other nine consonants and
how were they created? The first principle of letter formation
in Hangul is the principle of stroke addition. As you can see, the rest of
the nine consonants were formed by adding a stroke to each one
of the basic five consonants. Take a closer look. Adding one more stroke. One more stroke and two more strokes. Adding vertical strokes or
horizontal strokes. Adding strokes. Second letter is not in use any longer. Two strokes again. You might hae noticed that there
are some letters missing from the list. There are these three and there are exceptions to
the principle of letter formation. These letters are the palato-alveolar
sound [FOREIGN], the semi-dental sound and the velar sound,
which was modeled after the throat. However, these two are not
any longer in use. Okay, then shall we take a closer
look each of the consonants again? [FOREIGN] is not a strong K sound,
or a voiced G sound. But pronounced in a soft k
sound in an initial letter. [FOREIGN]
is a strong k sound. [FOREIGN]
is similar to the English n sound. And [FOREIGN] has the soft t
sound somewhere in the middle of T sound and a D sound. [FOREIGN]
is a strong T sound. [FOREIGN]
has the English M sound, and [FOREIGN] has a soft P sound
between a P sound and a B sound. [FOREIGN]
is a strong p sound. [FOREIGN], like I mentioned earlier,
is a different sound from the s sound and the c sound in that it resembles
a sound in between those two. But rather is a sound of air casing made by touching your tongue to
the gums of the upper teeth. Sounds like between S in sound and
SH in she. Sounds starts from the same place and
it resembles the J sound in the word job. [FOREIGN] is an aspirated
sound with a burst of air and it has the ch sound like
in the English word chapel. [FOREIGN] is silent
when used as an initial sound such as in [FOREIGN] and. When used as a final consonant, however,
it has the NG sound like in the word song. [FOREIGN] is a strong H sound. Lastly, their isn't an exact match to
the [FOREIGN] sound in English, but you consider it a sound in between
the l sound and the r sound. So when you prononce [FOREIGN],
it's not ramen or lamen, it's ramen. Well at this time let's repeat
the names of 14 consonants one more time to the operatic order
which is in the dictionary. Giyeok nieun digeut. [FOREIGN]
I know it's very hard to remember the names of the consonants but you don't have to remember them all of them in the beginning. Just take time to practice. When we pronounce these letters
with the first basic vowel Ka. Na. Ta. Ra. Ma. Ba. [FOREIGN] these letters, like the English alphabet, have a specific order. This is the order of the letters
created when the 14 consonants are combined in order with the 10 vowels. Repeat after me, [FOREIGN] well done. This is the order of the letters
in the dictionary, so it would be very helpful to memorize it. This time we will read words formed by
using the 14 consonants and the 10 vowels. You don't need to memorize all the words,
just practice reading them. All right, repeat after me, please. [FOREIGN] [FOREIGN] [FOREIGN] [FOREIGN] [FOREIGN] [FOREIGN] [FOREIGN] [FOREIGN] [FOREIGN] [FOREIGN] [FOREIGN] [FOREIGN] I think this unit is the most difficult part of learning Korean alphabet,
but I hope you just enjoy practicing. That's all for this unit. Thank you. Bye.
